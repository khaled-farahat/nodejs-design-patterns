# Module System

javascript lack module system for a long time.

when node.js was created, it came up with an implementation of the CommonJS.

in 2015, ES6 introduced a new module system called ECMAScript modules (ESM).

ECMAScript 6 defined only the formal specification for ESM in terms of syntax and semantics, but it didn't provide any implementation details.
