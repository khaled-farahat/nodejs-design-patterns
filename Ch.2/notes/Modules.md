# Modules

Node.js currently comes with two different module systems: CommonJS (CJS) and ECMAScript modules (ESM or ES modules).

## The need for modules

- Having a way to split the codebase into multiple files: code more organized, easier to maintain, and easier to understand.
- Allowing code reuse across different projects.
- Encapsulation (or information hiding).
- Managing dependencies.

## Module systems

module system is the syntax and the tooling that allows us to define modules and to use them within our projects.
